work on original projects--
- questions for the normal teams--
- macro economic impacts on the philipines
- tropical cyclone season is approaching
- need to study how this new reality affect capacity for disasters
	- and strategy for doing so
- 2 models:
	- 1 is household model based on FIES - shock income // break assets and see how long they rebuild, optimization problem
	- households take x long to recover, into poverty for y amount of time, baseline shifts.
- model 2:
	- asset stock, puts off GDP- 
	- stocatsic disaster, that generates loss on macro perspective
	- 
in parallel -- resilience capital ** stock
	- stock for reducing losses for disasters
	- every year, govt has choice between investing in capital stock, resilience stock, or not

00> we want to understand how COVID affects these, bank sells different policies for this etc, and will underwrite an insurance package based on these ideas,
00> fast-loans, providing the money right away
00> massive loan up to 5% of GDP or 500 million to help with aftermath recovery

CATDBL -- catastrophe deferred buyout option
resilience stock
-
- we expect the resilience should be built to cover the small cheap events, and not strive to prevent 100yr storm, but mitigate in various ways

- want to take into account effective productivity losses from covid
- deadline: intermediate results end of June
- 

macro model is also montecarlo based
- runs lots of simulations and see how they all add up
- 
model 1: 40k households, 50 hazards-- lots of optimization steps

to do this well, macro model is the place-- 
to get going:
B -- will resend me the code, i will get familiar
	-- pretty big structural changes need to be made--
		- no labor in the model
		-- need to add (currently just capital)
B -- will send a paper too
 -- structural development: put in labor and production function is correct
 -- MFmod (production model)
 --	paper from aug/sept on that

 -- and then calibrate to economy of the phillipines
 -- have potential regions

 -- incorporate climate change and disasters-- they have one disaster every 10 years-- huge space to improve upon the outcomes
 -- macro-econ component is critical to see
 -- 

 - question of diverting capital stock to income stream etc
 - rate of return on household income etc
 - 
 -- this week: 3 daysa week, get model running, and compare to mfMOD paper to verify
 -- **VALIDATE PRODUCTION FUNCTION and ADD LABOR TO IT **
 -- MFMOD paper lists equations and data that they use to calibrate-- use this to pull in the labor data
 -- referencing WB database with API --
 -- as think about structure, make sure to pull in this API for database etc --
 -- take note of variables referencing -- 
 -- think about it being scalable --
 -- for us, representation of disasters in MFMod --
 -- post covid universe is one flavor --

 -- longterm goal is to keep me. -- 

 meeting weds or thurs -- 830pm PST -- decision meeting
 xubei -- she has incorporated our work into report on phillipines
 -- will be discussed by phillipines portfolio managers
