Model_notes_20200515.txt

overall structure:
- 2 classes:
	- iteration
		-
	- sequence
		-

- 1 function:
	- run_model
		- this sets all the parameters with defaults
		- 

- three scenarios run: (stored as object/vars)
	-baseline
	- invest_scenario
	- invest_loan_scenario

program run:
1] runmodel calls program
	2] 


equations:
production and labor:
- production: pg 25, eqn 51 (pg26)

- labor: "labor Market" pg 17, eqn 22

notes to self: 
gamma = capital stock decay

Questions:
- how exactly does our model compute & store values.
- trying to find the entry point into our equations
-- implementation point options:
	- class iteration--> # annual endogenous --> ergo: def update.stocks ?
		-- as part of last year functionality?

- how to integrate the labor and production functions
	- data driven? --> access to the WB database?
	- implementation as parameterization?
	- fixed or updating responses based on shock timing?
	-


dr-mfmod questions:
- capex = capital expense
- adaptex = adaptation expense??? -- cost to set up adaptation?

- line: class sequence -- seed--> is this just being stored as an object variable for accounting purposes and inquiry? I dont see it being intitialized or defined anywhere and is not coming from anything

- inside 'iteration' class:
	- what is 'get_aal_function' ?
